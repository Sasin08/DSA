<b>Kth Permutation Sequence</b>

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the k-th permutation sequence of the numbers [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

You must not generate all the permutations. Your solution should be efficient and use mathematical logic.

Example:

Input: n = 4, k = 9

Output: "2314"

Explanation:

The 9th permutation of [1,2,3,4] in lexicographic order is "2314".

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 9

1 <= k <= n!

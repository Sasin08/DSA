<b>Kth smallest element in the array using constant space when array can't be modified</b>

Given an array arr[] of size N having no duplicates and an integer K, the task is to find the Kth smallest element from the array in constant extra space and the array can't be modified.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 

Output: 7 

Given array in sorted is {3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20} 

where 7 is the third smallest element.

Input: arr[] = {12, 3, 5, 7, 19}, K = 2 

Output: 5
